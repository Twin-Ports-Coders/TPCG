@Andrea - Note that when I cloned this repo over to this organization, it was before the image changes.  Also, the structure of the discussions that I made the old repo at npollesch/twin-ports-coders-group didn't come over either, so we may need to 'remake' the discussions section within the new Twin-Ports-Coders ORG, as it seems like when there is an ORG, the discussions belong to the ORG and not to an individual repo.
